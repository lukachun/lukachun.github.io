###1.  给定Weather表，编写SQL查询找出所有温度较前一天高的记录Id

+---------+------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------+------------------+
|      1 | 2015-01-01 |              10 |
|      2 | 2015-01-02 |              25 |
|      3 | 2015-01-03 |              20 |
|      4 | 2015-01-04 |              30 |
+---------+------------+------------------+
sql: select w1.id from Weather as w1 join Weather as w2 on TO_DAYS(w1.Date) = TO_DAYS(w2.Date) + 1 and w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature

###2. Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
sql: delete p1 from Person as p1 join Person p2 on p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id;
sql: delete p1 from Person as p1 where p1.Id not in (select min(p2.Id) from Person as p2 group by p2.Email)

###3.The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe  | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam  | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max  | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

sql:select d.Name as Department, c.Name as Employee,c.Salary from Department as d join select a.* from Employee as a where (select count(distinct b.Salary) from Employee as b where a.DepartmentId=b.DepartmentId and a.Salary <= b.Salary) <=3) as c on d.Id=c.DepartmentId order by d.Name,c.Salary desc;

The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

sql:select d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary from Department as d join (select * from Employee as a where a.Salary >= (select max(b.Salary) from Employee as b where a.DepartmentId=b.DepartmentId) order by a.DepartmentId) as e on d.Id = e.DepartmentId;

###4.Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL

query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe  |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam  |
| 4  | Max  |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
sql:select c.Name from  Customers as c left join Orders as o on c.Id = o.CustomerId where o.Id is null;
注意：A left join B on 后面的限制条件只针对于B，另外如果需要过滤join之后的结果只能使用where

###5. Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
sql: select distinct(d.Num) from Logs as d join (select a.Id as Id1, a.Num as Num from Logs as a join Logs as b on a.Num = b.Num and a.Id = b.Id+1) as c on d.Id = c.Id1-2 and d.Num = c.Num;
---

###6.Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
sql: select distinct(a.Salary) from Employee as a join (select distinct Salary from Employee) as b on a.Salary <= b.Salary group by a.Id having count(a.Salary)=N
